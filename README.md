This project is using the Johnny-Five library to cycle through colors on a Tri-Color LED, dependent on a pressure sensor.

To run the code, clone the repo, cd into the directory, and run `npm install`. Then run `node colors.js`. The pressure sensor input will be logged in the terminal.

Video is below. You'll need an Arduino (set up with the Firmata protocol), a tri-color LED, and a few resistors. (I destroyed my first LED by forgetting the resistors. Oops.)
